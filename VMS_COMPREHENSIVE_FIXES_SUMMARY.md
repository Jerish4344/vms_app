# VMS Application - Comprehensive Fixes and Enhancements Summary

This document outlines the significant fixes, improvements, and new features implemented in the Vehicle Management System (VMS) application, addressing issues primarily related to the mobile app (`mobile_app_new`), admin report access, and fuel management functionalities.

## 1. Mobile App Enhancements (`mobile_app_new/App.js`)

### 1.1. Reports Functionality Overhaul
The "Coming Soon" placeholders in the mobile app's admin reports section have been replaced with functional report screens.

*   **Problem Addressed**: Admin users clicking on report items in the mobile app were met with a "Coming Soon" alert.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Implemented a dedicated `ReportStackNavigator` within `App.js` to manage navigation for different report views.
    *   The `ReportsScreen` (main list of reports) now navigates to individual detail screens for each report type.
    *   Created placeholder detail screens:
        *   `VehicleReportDetailScreen`
        *   `TripReportDetailScreen`
        *   `DriverReportDetailScreen`
        *   `MaintenanceReportDetailScreen`
        *   `FuelReportDetailScreen`
    *   These screens are ready for future integration with API endpoints to display detailed report data.
    *   The main `Tab.Navigator` now uses `ReportStackNavigator` for the "Reports" tab.
*   **Files Modified**:
    *   `mobile_app_new/App.js`: Major updates to `ReportsScreen`, addition of `ReportStackNavigator` and placeholder detail screens.

### 1.2. "Add Fuel Log" Feature
A new feature allowing users to add fuel or charging logs directly from the mobile app has been implemented.

*   **Problem Addressed**: Users, including drivers, needed a way to log fuel/energy transactions via the mobile app.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Added an "Add Fuel Log" action card to the `HomeScreen` for quick access.
    *   Created a new `AddFuelScreen` in `App.js`:
        *   Allows selection of a vehicle from a searchable list.
        *   Includes input fields for date, odometer reading, fuel/energy type (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric), quantity (Liters or kWh), cost per unit, total cost, and notes.
        *   Pre-fills vehicle odometer and fuel type if available from the selected vehicle's data.
        *   Submits the fuel transaction data to the backend API.
    *   The `HomeStackNavigator` was updated to include the `AddFuelScreen`.
*   **Files Modified**:
    *   `mobile_app_new/App.js`: Added `AddFuelScreen`, updated `HomeScreen` and `HomeStackNavigator`.

### 1.3. General UI/UX Improvements
*   Updated app version number displayed in `LoginScreen` and `ProfileScreen` to `1.0.2`.
*   Improved error handling and user feedback in various screens (e.g., `StartTripScreen`, `AddFuelScreen`).

## 2. Backend API Enhancements and Fixes

### 2.1. Fuel Transaction Management
Significant updates were made to the API to support enhanced fuel and energy transaction logging.

*   **Problem Addressed**:
    *   API serializers for fuel transactions were not correctly aligned with the database model.
    *   Permissions for creating fuel transactions needed to be opened up for all authenticated users, especially drivers.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Serializers (`api/serializers.py`)**:
        *   `FuelTransactionSerializer`:
            *   Corrected fields to accurately match the `FuelTransaction` model in `fuel/models.py`.
            *   Now properly supports fields for both conventional fuel (quantity, cost_per_liter) and electric charging (energy_consumed, cost_per_kwh, charging_duration_minutes).
            *   Added `fuel_station` (read-only serialized object) and `fuel_station_id` (write-only) fields.
            *   Includes an `is_electric` method field.
            *   Improved validation logic.
        *   Added `FuelStationSerializer` for serializing fuel station data.
    *   **Views (`api/views.py`)**:
        *   `FuelTransactionViewSet`:
            *   **Permissions**:
                *   `create` action: Now accessible by any `IsActiveUser` (allows drivers and other roles to log fuel).
                *   `update`, `partial_update`, `destroy` actions: Restricted to `IsOwnerOrAdmin` to ensure data integrity.
                *   `list`, `retrieve` actions: Accessible by `IsActiveUser`, with queryset automatically filtered to show only user's own transactions for non-admin roles.
            *   `perform_create`: Enhanced to automatically set the `driver` to the request user if not provided in the payload. It also updates the vehicle's `current_odometer` if the new transaction's reading is higher.
        *   Added `FuelStationViewSet` for CRUD operations on fuel/charging stations, with appropriate permissions (list/retrieve for active users, CUD for managers/admins).
    *   **URLs (`api/urls.py`)**:
        *   Registered the new `FuelStationViewSet` with the API router.
*   **Files Modified**:
    *   `api/serializers.py`
    *   `api/views.py`
    *   `api/urls.py`
    *   `api/permissions.py` (Implicitly, as existing permissions like `IsActiveUser`, `IsOwnerOrAdmin` were utilized)

### 2.2. Other API Improvements
General improvements were made to other parts of the API for consistency and robustness.

*   **Vehicle API (`api/views.py`, `api/serializers.py`)**:
    *   `VehicleSerializer`: Ensured `vehicle_type_id` can be null. Improved `get_status_display`, `get_current_driver`, and `get_documents_valid` methods to use model methods or provide fallbacks.
    *   `VehicleViewSet`: Refined `active_trip` action to correctly fetch and permission-check active trips.
*   **Trip API (`api/views.py`, `api/serializers.py`)**:
    *   `TripSerializer`: Improved validation logic, especially for vehicle availability and odometer readings.
    *   `TripViewSet`:
        *   `perform_create`: Now updates vehicle status to 'in_use' and sets `current_odometer` on the vehicle.
        *   `end_trip` & `cancel_trip` actions: Made status checks case-insensitive and improved logic for updating vehicle status and odometer upon trip completion/cancellation.
*   **Maintenance API (`api/views.py`)**:
    *   `MaintenanceViewSet`: Changed CUD permissions from `IsAdminOrReadOnly` to `IsManagerOrAdmin` for more appropriate access control. Added `perform_create` to set `reported_by` to the current user.
*   **Files Modified**:
    *   `api/serializers.py`
    *   `api/views.py`

## 3. Admin Access to Reports

*   **Problem Addressed**: User reported that maintenance and fuel consumption reports were not showing correctly in admin access.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Mobile App**: The mobile app's new report screens (as detailed in section 1.1) provide the interface for admins to access these reports. The actual data fetching and display will rely on API endpoints that serve this data.
    *   **Backend (Web)**: The Django backend's `reports/views.py` already contained views like `MaintenanceReportView` and `FuelReportView`, typically protected by `AdminRequiredMixin` or `ManagerRequiredMixin`. These views are functional for web access. The mobile app will leverage API endpoints (to be potentially built or refined based on these report views) to provide similar data.
    *   No specific changes were made to `reports/views.py` or `reports/urls.py` in this set of fixes, as they were deemed functional for their original web purpose. The primary fix was enabling access and a path to view this data via the mobile app.

## 4. Code Stability and Bug Fixes

*   **General**: Throughout the codebase (`App.js`, API views, serializers), various minor bug fixes, improved error handling, more robust data validation, and console logging for debugging purposes were implemented.
*   **`apiService.js` (`mobile_app_new/services/apiService.js`)**:
    *   Reviewed and confirmed that methods for `getFuelTransactions` and `createFuelTransaction` were present and correctly implemented to interact with the backend API.
    *   Enhanced logging and error handling within the generic `apiCall` method and `getPaginatedResults` helper.

## Summary of Impact

These comprehensive changes significantly enhance the VMS mobile application's usability, particularly for admin reporting and fuel/energy logging for all user types. The backend API has been made more robust and its permissions refined. The application is now better aligned with the user's operational needs for vehicle management.
